#### Goals
You should segment the sample of customer base in order to find the key consumer segments and create the marketing strategy to achieve the companyâ€™s goal.  
1. Analyze the data. What features are there in the dataset? Which of them may be useful for the segmentation? Clean the dataset if needed.
2. Use the cohorts to analyze the customers activity in dynamics. What can be said about the customers behavior? 
3. Perform the cluster analysis. Choose the optimal number of clusters (should be shown) and features (try various combinations to find the most appropriate one). Generate additional features if they are needed.
